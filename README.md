# Reestablishing Authoritarianism and its Relationship to Political Outcomes

Luttig (2021) contends that authoritarianism is endogenous to party identification, using a two-wave cross lagged panel regression. In this paper, we demonstrate the complexities of the causal diagram advocated by Luttig, and the the potential confounded relationship he demonstrates by failing to adopt a more thorough Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which accounts for both colliders and backdoor patterns. These limitations are addressed in several ways, starting with a conceptual critique, then a Monte Carlo Experiment, followed with a more thorough deriviation of the causal estimands, their assumptions, and results which dispute the claim that authoritarianism is endogenous to elite-driven, partisan appeals.
